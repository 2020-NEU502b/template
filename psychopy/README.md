## Resources
The documentation for *psychopy* can be found at their [site](http://www.psychopy.org/documentation.html).
You are more than welcome to use their [GUI builder](http://www.psychopy.org/builder/builder.html),
but are encouraged to [script](http://www.psychopy.org/coder/coder.html) your experiments.

Outside of the official documentation, *Programming for Psychology in Python* has an excellent [psychopy tutorial](http://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming/vision/intro/intro.html). The psychopy experiments from 2018-NEU502b are available [here](https://github.com/szorowi1/pni-courses/tree/master/neu502b/psychopy).

Sam also has a copy of [Building Experiments in PsychoPy](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Experiments-PsychoPy-Jonathan-Peirce/dp/1473991390) at his desk, which you are all welcome to borrow. There is also a copy at the [Princeton Lewis Library](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/10892742).
